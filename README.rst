Description
===========

A very *incomplete* python client for
database applications on http://www.quickbase.com.

When I wrote this, the only thing I could find was the ruby quickbase client,
released by Intuit.  So I wrote the functionality I needed in order to get my
work done.  Please feel free to clone/fork this and add the functionality you
need.


Requirements
============

You will need pycurl and lxml (python bindings for libxml2 and libxslt -- you'll obviously need those as well).
